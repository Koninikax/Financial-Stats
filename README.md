# Financial-Stats
A MS Excel Dashboard that analyses the financial statistics of an ecommerce business.
## Steps
1. Found the Total Sales of all the orders over 12 months for each region and segment.
2. Analysed the product's Category-wise Profit and Sales and prepare a chart for the Sales and Profit Pattern for various months.
3. Determined the Top Paying customers so that special Premium discount can be offered to such clients.
4. Found the Best Selling Products among the different segments.
5. Determine the YOY growth for multiple Key Metrics.

   
Therefore, I conducted in-depth data analysis on E-commerce Sales Data to gain some meaningful insights for each region and segment and developed an interactive dashboard with 5 KPIs,multiple filters and 6 dynamic charts in Excel. I created a Combo Chart for showcasing Sales of the products and Profits from each month and determined the Best Selling Products and the Top 5 Premium Customers. A Pie Chart and Column Chart for Category-wise Profit and Sales were built with an additional Map Chart for showcasing Sales by State.
